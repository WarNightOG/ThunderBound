    <h2>
            History of this Journey
           </h2>
           <p>
            This epic thing starts in 2019 in the corona virus time when everyone
            was sitting free in his home, A SMP came in the was of light called Four Legends created by HassaJaved
            also known as (WarNightOG) He and his 2 cousins Maryam also known as (silent_Girl or Pro_Devil_Girl)
            and AzkaRabeeb also known as (Queen_Girl) and one of his enemy, his brother they started playing that 
            was a time than i miss every time. We did the things that no one did. Then a time came when
            I HassanJaved (WarNightOG) grew up and tried to make website from Google sites and Wordpress, I took 
            success but not that much to cross the sky and reach the space. I learned too much and too much about
            how the universe of Internet works I learned and understood the algorithm of youtube facebook instagram
            etc. Then a time came when i got interested in Programming. I was already very disapointed because
            of my father's job was taken resently. (2023) July-23 I found a course of of CodeWithHarry
            of Python. I learned first 2 chapters and i adopted its not enough for me i did only 2 chapters 
            to understand some consepts but my vision was not like this! I did his Full Web devolopment course's
            first 30 videos understanded 3 legendary languages (HTML,CSS,JavaScript) Then my School's
            anuall papers got started and I defeated my enemies in Exames may i tell you it was not a small School Exames
            it was United Charter School near to Becon House standard After some success from school be holidays were
            started I enjoyed and mostly invested time to this. There was a time when i felt so alone doing Programming
            because my brothers were always abusing me "Codin is nothing, Play games" It was very hard to admit
            but i left their opinion. And started making websites i struglled too much like I cannot explain
            how i felt at night midnight then evening these times were killing me! But as all of we known 
            "When there is no calm out side of you, You must find the calm inside of you" this Ninjago 
            dialog took me away from this un named feeling and because taste of patience is better than
            rocks of mud.2024 I made websites,Ai bots Servers. And i applied every thing. and now 2025 I am
            able to make ChatGPT AI bots Proper Websites even in this website where you are reading
            is made by my pure hands. Now in 2025 I am starting a jouney called "Fog into the unknown"
            This wil help me to grow more but i will never forget this feeling i had more than 2 Years.
            Just remember There will be a time when every where arround will be caous so remember
            "When there is no calm outside of you,you must find the calm inside of you."
